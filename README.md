# AccordiaTaskWeb

## Project Introduction
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.
<br></br>

This is the frontend UI and logic code of building a web app per Accordia task requirements.
This web app project is about an AI Resume Chatbot, where user can chat with the chatbot about their resume (would be able to upload their resume, can also copy paste text) and also send any job links to the AI chatbot where if it manages to access it, it should be able to tell the user more about the job and also compare it against the user's resume.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
